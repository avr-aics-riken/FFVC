OUTLINE
=======

Frontflow/violet Cartesian is a three-dimensional unsteady incompressible thermal flow
simulator on a Cartesian grid system. This solver is designed so as to assist practical 
design in industry fields by powerful voxel based approach and to achieve higher parallel
performance on massively parallel computers.
